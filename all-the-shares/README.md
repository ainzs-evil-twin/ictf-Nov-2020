# all-the-shares

## Description

OK I'll spoil the challenge for you. Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing  
Can you figure out the minimum number of shares required and extract them from this [ELF](../main/all-the-shares/guess) to get the secret?  
After you have obtained the secret, convert it to ascii, put that after 'pastebin.com/' and visit the link to get the flag.
